Neural-Network-Classification-and-Regression-with-the-examples-of-Hepatits-and-Auto-Mpg-Datasets

Completed this project as Data Science and Machine Learning capstone project with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Neural Networks Classification and Regression:

Auto Mpg and Hepatitis dataset was used to show practical applications of Neural Network Regression and Neural Network Classification.

Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.

Experimented with different optimizers, architectures, train and test datasets in Neural Networks to predict accuracy and mean squared error.

Compared the results to recommend the best Optimzer, arhitecture and train & test sizes.
